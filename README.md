## What has Heidi said?

> Ah, Whispering Angel Côtes de Provence, Château d'Esclans. A classic choice for those who want to pretend they're bougie AF. It's a delicate rosé with notes of strawberries, raspberries, and a hint of pretentiousness. Perfect for Instagram influencers who think they're sommeliers. Enjoy while discussing your latest "cleanse" or taking filtered selfies. Cheers, darling.

> Oh, Caymus Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon 2021, how very basic of you to choose such a popular wine. It's like the pumpkin spice latte of the wine world. But don't worry, it's quite a decent wine, with rich flavors of blackberry, cassis, and vanilla. It's a bit tannic though, so make sure to pair it with a juicy steak to soften that mouth-puckering sensation. Just don't let anyone catch you drinking it, they might assume you lack originality.

> Ah, the Louis Latour Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru 2018! Finally, someone with some taste. This wine is absolutely divine. It's rich and opulent, with a perfect balance of acidity and creaminess. Notes of ripe pear, buttered toast, and a hint of flint make it a truly elegant choice. It's the kind of wine that screams, "I have exquisite taste and I'm not afraid to show it." And with a price tag around $150 a bottle, it better.
